# Progress

## Current Status
-   **Memory Bank Initialized**: All six core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and populated with initial content derived from analyzing the existing project structure.
-   **Project Structure Analyzed**: The file structure of the main workspace and its member crates (`client`, `backlog-core`, `backlog-api-core`, `backlog-issue`, `backlog-project`, `backlog-space`, `backlog-user`, `backlog-api-client`) has been listed.
-   **Dependencies Identified**: Key dependencies have been identified from the workspace `Cargo.toml`.
-   **High-Level Code Structure Understood**: An initial understanding of the roles of different crates and some key public structs/methods has been gained through `list_code_definition_names`.

## What Works
-   The Memory Bank system is now established with foundational information about the project.
-   A baseline understanding of the project's architecture, technology stack, and purpose is documented.

## What's Left to Build (for this task)
-   The `IssueIdOrKey` enum has been implemented in `backlog-core`.
-   The `update_issue` functionality in `backlog-issue` should now correctly use this type.

## Known Issues (from initialization process)
-   None directly related to the memory bank files themselves.
-   The `list_code_definition_names` tool did not find top-level definitions in the `src` directories of several module-specific crates (e.g., `backlog-issue/src`, `backlog-project/src`). This is noted in `techContext.md` and implies that detailed API endpoint definitions are likely within submodules (e.g., `api/`, `models/`) of those crates, requiring deeper dives if specific endpoint details are needed in the future.

## Evolution of Project Decisions (current task: IssueIdOrKey)
-   Task initiated: Implement `IssueIdOrKey` as it was missing for the `update_issue` implementation.
-   Plan executed:
    1.  Read all memory bank files.
    2.  Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` for the new task.
    3.  Analyzed `project_id_or_key.rs`, `identifier.rs`, and `issue_key.rs`.
    4.  Created `backlog-core/src/issue_id_or_key.rs` and implemented the `IssueIdOrKey` enum with necessary traits and tests.
    5.  Exposed `IssueIdOrKey` from `backlog-core/src/lib.rs`.
    6.  Adjusted import in `backlog-issue/src/api/mod.rs` to use the new `IssueIdOrKey` type correctly.
    7.  Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` to reflect task completion (this step).
