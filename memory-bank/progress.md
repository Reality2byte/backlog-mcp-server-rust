# Progress

## Current Status
-   **Memory Bank Initialized**: All six core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and populated with initial content derived from analyzing the existing project structure.
-   **Project Structure Analyzed**: The file structure of the main workspace and its member crates has been listed.
-   **Dependencies Identified**: Key dependencies have been identified from the workspace `Cargo.toml`.
-   **High-Level Code Structure Understood**: An initial understanding of the roles of different crates and some key public structs/methods has been gained.
-   **`mcp-backlog-server` Crate Exists**: A dedicated crate for the Backlog MCP server (`mcp-backlog-server`) with tools like `get_issue_details` and `get_document_details` has been found to be already implemented.
-   **`get_version_milestone_list` API Implemented**: The `get_version_milestone_list` API has been successfully implemented in the `backlog-issue` crate, including model updates and tests.
-   **`get_version_milestone_list` MCP Tool Implemented**: The `get_version_milestone_list` MCP tool has been successfully implemented in the `mcp-backlog-server` crate.
-   **`get_issues_by_milestone_name` MCP Tool Implemented**: The `get_issues_by_milestone_name` MCP tool has been successfully implemented in the `mcp-backlog-server` crate.
-   **Improved Error Messaging**: The error message for `MilestoneNotFoundByName` in `mcp-backlog-server` has been improved to suggest using `get_version_milestone_list`.
-   **Suggestion Feature for MilestoneNotFoundByName**: Implemented a feature in `mcp-backlog-server` to provide suggestions of similar milestone names if an exact match is not found. This uses preprocessing and Levenshtein distance.
-   **`update_issue` MCP Tool Implemented**: The `update_issue` MCP tool has been implemented in `mcp-backlog-server`, allowing updates to issue summary and description. This tool is available when the `issue_writable` feature is enabled.

## What Works
-   The Memory Bank system is established with foundational information about the project.
-   A baseline understanding of the project's architecture, technology stack, and purpose is documented.
-   The `backlog-api-client` library provides core functionality for Backlog API interaction.
-   The `mcp-backlog-server` provides MCP tools for:
    - Issue details (`get_issue_details`)
    - Document details (`get_document_details`)
    - Project versions/milestones list (`get_version_milestone_list`)
    - Issues by milestone name (`get_issues_by_milestone_name`)
    - Updating issues (`update_issue`) (when `issue_writable` feature is enabled)
-   The `mcp-backlog-server` now provides more helpful error messages when a milestone is not found by name, including suggestions for similar names.
-   The `backlog-issue` crate can retrieve a list of versions (milestones) for a project and update issues (when `writable` feature is enabled).

## What's Left to Build (for this task)
-   Finalizing Memory Bank updates for the `update_issue` MCP tool implementation.
-   Confirming task completion with the user.

## Known Issues (from initialization process and ongoing work)
-   The `list_code_definition_names` tool did not find top-level definitions in the `src` directories of several module-specific crates (e.g., `backlog-issue/src`, `backlog-project/src`). This is noted in `techContext.md`.
-   The `download_attachment` method in `backlog-document/src/api.rs` is a placeholder and requires `client::Client` modification for full functionality.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
-   **Initial Project Setup**: Focused on creating the Backlog API client library and CLI.
-   **`backlog-document` Crate**: Implemented based on user request for Document API features.
-   **MCP Server Request**: User requested creation of an MCP server with a `get_issue_details` tool.
-   **Discovery of Existing MCP Server**: During a previous "update memory-bank" task, it was discovered that the `mcp-backlog-server` crate with the requested tool (and more) already exists.
-   **Previous Task Focus**: Shifted from creating the MCP server to accurately documenting its existing structure and functionality within the Memory Bank.
-   **`get_version_milestone_list` Implementation**: User requested implementation of `get_version_milestone_list` in `backlog-issue`. This involved:
    -   Reading API documentation.
    -   Updating the `Milestone` model in `backlog-issue/src/models/issue.rs` to include `display_order`.
    -   Adding the `get_version_milestone_list` method and tests to `backlog-issue/src/api/mod.rs`.
    -   Resolving associated compilation errors.
-   **`get_version_milestone_list` MCP Tool Implementation**: User requested implementation of `get_version_milestone_list` tool in `mcp-backlog-server`. This involved:
    -   Defining `GetVersionMilestoneListRequest` in `mcp-backlog-server/src/server.rs`.
    -   Implementing `get_version_milestone_list_impl` helper in `mcp-backlog-server/src/issue.rs`.
    -   Adding the `get_version_milestone_list` tool method to `Server` in `mcp-backlog-server/src/server.rs`.
-   **`get_issues_by_milestone_name` MCP Tool Implementation**: User requested implementation of this tool. This involved:
    -   Defining `GetIssuesByMilestoneNameRequest`.
    -   Implementing `get_issues_by_milestone_name_impl` helper (including logic to find milestone ID by name and then fetch issues).
    -   Adding the `get_issues_by_milestone_name` tool method.
    -   Adding `MilestoneNotFoundByName` error and updating `From<Error> for McpError`.
    -   Adding `From` traits to `ProjectIdOrKey` in `backlog-core` to fix compilation errors.
-   **Error Message Improvement**: User requested more helpful error messages when a milestone is not found by name.
    -   Updated `From<Error> for McpError` for `MilestoneNotFoundByName` in `mcp-backlog-server/src/error.rs` to suggest using `get_version_milestone_list`.
-   **Suggestion Feature Implementation for `MilestoneNotFoundByName`**: User requested that when a milestone name is not found, the error should include suggestions for similar names.
    -   Discussed string similarity algorithms (Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler, N-gram, etc.).
    -   Decided on a two-step approach: 1. Preprocessing + exact match. 2. If not found, Levenshtein distance (<=2) on preprocessed names, sorted by distance then common prefix length.
    -   Added `strsim` dependency to `mcp-backlog-server/Cargo.toml`.
    -   Updated `MilestoneNotFoundByName` error in `mcp-backlog-server/src/error.rs` to include an optional `suggestions: Vec<String>` field and updated the `From<Error> for McpError` implementation to format these suggestions into the error message.
    -   Modified `get_issues_by_milestone_name_impl` in `mcp-backlog-server/src/issue.rs` to implement the suggestion logic. If a preprocessed exact match is found, issues are fetched. Otherwise, Levenshtein suggestions are generated and returned within the `MilestoneNotFoundByName` error.
-   **`update_issue` MCP Tool Implementation**: User requested implementation of an `update_issue` tool.
    -   Added `issue_writable` feature to `mcp-backlog-server/Cargo.toml`, linking to `backlog-api-client/issue_writable`.
    -   Defined `UpdateIssueRequest` (with `issue_id_or_key`, `summary`, `description`) in `mcp-backlog-server/src/server.rs`.
    -   Added `NothingToUpdate` error to `mcp-backlog-server/src/error.rs`.
    -   Implemented `update_issue_impl` helper in `mcp-backlog-server/src/issue.rs` (guarded by `issue_writable` feature), which calls the client library and handles the `NothingToUpdate` case.
    -   Added `update_issue` tool method to `Server` in `mcp-backlog-server/src/server.rs` (guarded by `issue_writable` feature).
    -   Corrected `Cargo.toml` formatting and ensured compilation with `cargo check --features issue_writable`.
-   **Current Task Focus**: Updating Memory Bank to reflect these recent changes.
