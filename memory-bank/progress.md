# Progress

## Current Status
-   **Memory Bank Initialized**: Core files created and populated.
-   **Project Structure Analyzed**.
-   **Dependencies Identified**.
-   **High-Level Code Structure Understood**.
-   **`mcp-backlog-server` Crate Exists**.
-   **Various API Endpoints Implemented**: `get_version_milestone_list`, `get_issues_by_milestone_name`, `update_issue`, Git/PR viewing, CLI issue commands, `get_comment_list`, `get_issue_comments` MCP tool.
-   **Refactoring and Code Quality**: `mcp-backlog-server` refactored, Clippy warnings addressed, code formatted.
-   **Comprehensive Error Handling & Dependency Refactoring ("100-Point Plan")**: Completed.
-   **Error Handling Enhancements**: Completed.
-   **"Get Status List of Project" API Implemented**:
    -   `Status` model defined in `backlog-project` with all fields (`id`, `project_id`, `name`, `color`, `display_order`).
    -   `backlog-issue` updated to use `backlog_project::Status` for `Issue.status`, removing its local incomplete `Status` definition. This involved adding a dependency `backlog-issue -> backlog-project`.
    -   `get_status_list` method implemented in `backlog-project::ProjectApi`.
    -   Unit tests added for `get_status_list`.
    -   `schemars` support added to `backlog-project` and `Status`.
    -   `backlog-api-client` updated to re-export `Status`.
-   **Test Utilities Commonized**:
    -   `setup_client` test helper moved to `client::test_utils` and made available via a `test-utils` feature in the `client` crate.
    -   Dependent crates (`backlog-project`, `backlog-issue`) updated to use this common helper and enable the feature.
-   **Verification**: All changes successfully verified with `cargo build --all-features`, `cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test --all-features --all-targets`.

## What Works
-   The Memory Bank system is established and updated.
-   A baseline understanding of the project's architecture, technology stack, and purpose is documented.
-   **Unified Error Handling**: Consistent error handling via `backlog_api_core::Error`.
-   **Improved API Facade**: `backlog-api-client` acts as a strong facade.
-   **Simplified Consumer Dependencies**: `mcp-backlog-server` depends primarily on `backlog-api-client`.
-   The `backlog-api-client` library provides core functionality for Backlog API interaction, including:
    -   Git repository listing and details.
    -   Pull request listing and details.
    -   Issue listing, details, updates, and comment listing. (Issue status now uses a complete model from `backlog-project`).
    -   Document listing and details.
    -   Project listing, details, and **project status listing** (newly added).
    -   Space details.
    -   User details.
-   The `blg` CLI tool provides commands for various operations.
-   The `mcp-backlog-server` provides a suite of MCP tools. Error reporting is informative.
-   The codebase is free of Clippy warnings and consistently formatted. All tests pass.
-   Test utilities like `setup_client` are now shared from the `client` crate.

## What's Left to Build (for this task)
-   "Get Status List of Project" feature implementation is complete.
-   Potential next steps, if requested:
    -   Integrate `get_status_list` into the `blg` CLI tool.
    -   Integrate `get_status_list` into an MCP tool in `mcp-backlog-server`.
-   Complete full definitions for stubbed request parameter structs in `backlog-issue/src/requests/mod.rs`.

## Known Issues (from initialization process and ongoing work)
-   The `list_code_definition_names` tool did not find top-level definitions in the `src` directories of several module-specific crates.
-   The `download_attachment` method in `backlog-document/src/api.rs` is a placeholder.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
-   **Initial Project Setup**: Focused on creating the Backlog API client library and CLI.
-   (Previous items omitted for brevity - assume they are still relevant)
-   **`get_comment_list` Library Implementation**: User requested to implement issue comment retrieval.
-   **`get_issue_comments` MCP Tool Implementation**: User requested to implement an MCP tool to get issue comments.
-   **Error Handling Improvement**: Enhanced error handling in API client and MCP server.
-   **"Get Status List of Project" Implementation & `Status` Model Refactor**:
    -   User requested to add "Get Status List of Project" API to `backlog-project`.
    -   Discovered that the existing `Status` model in `backlog-issue` was incomplete compared to API responses for issue details.
    -   Decided to define a new, complete `Status` model in `backlog-project` to represent project-level status definitions.
    -   Updated `backlog-issue` to depend on `backlog-project` and use `Status` for the `Issue.status` field, ensuring data consistency.
    -   Commonized the `setup_client` test helper function into `client::test_utils` to be shared across test suites.
