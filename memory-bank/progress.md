# Progress

## Current Status
-   **Memory Bank Initialized**: All six core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and populated with initial content derived from analyzing the existing project structure.
-   **Project Structure Analyzed**: The file structure of the main workspace and its member crates (`client`, `backlog-core`, `backlog-api-core`, `backlog-issue`, `backlog-project`, `backlog-space`, `backlog-user`, `backlog-api-client`) has been listed.
-   **Dependencies Identified**: Key dependencies have been identified from the workspace `Cargo.toml`.
-   **High-Level Code Structure Understood**: An initial understanding of the roles of different crates and some key public structs/methods has been gained through `list_code_definition_names`.

## What Works
-   The Memory Bank system is now established with foundational information about the project.
-   A baseline understanding of the project's architecture, technology stack, and purpose is documented.

## What's Left to Build (for this task)
-   This task (initializing the memory bank and populating it based on existing files) is now complete.

## Known Issues (from initialization process)
-   None directly related to the memory bank files themselves.
-   The `list_code_definition_names` tool did not find top-level definitions in the `src` directories of several module-specific crates (e.g., `backlog-issue/src`, `backlog-project/src`). This is noted in `techContext.md` and implies that detailed API endpoint definitions are likely within submodules (e.g., `api/`, `models/`) of those crates, requiring deeper dives if specific endpoint details are needed in the future.

## Evolution of Project Decisions (during initialization)
-   Initial plan was to just create placeholder files.
-   Revised plan (based on user request) to also analyze existing project files and populate the memory bank with derived information. This more detailed approach has been executed.
