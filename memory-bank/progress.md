# Progress

## Current Status
-   **Memory Bank Initialized**: All six core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and populated with initial content derived from analyzing the existing project structure.
-   **Project Structure Analyzed**: The file structure of the main workspace and its member crates has been listed.
-   **Dependencies Identified**: Key dependencies have been identified from the workspace `Cargo.toml`.
-   **High-Level Code Structure Understood**: An initial understanding of the roles of different crates and some key public structs/methods has been gained.
-   **`mcp-backlog-server` Crate Exists**: A dedicated crate for the Backlog MCP server (`mcp-backlog-server`) with tools like `get_issue_details` and `get_document_details` has been found to be already implemented.

## What Works
-   The Memory Bank system is established with foundational information about the project.
-   A baseline understanding of the project's architecture, technology stack, and purpose is documented.
-   The `backlog-api-client` library provides core functionality for Backlog API interaction.
-   The `mcp-backlog-server` provides MCP tools for issue and document details.

## What's Left to Build (for this task)
-   This task (update memory-bank) is currently in progress.
-   The goal is to ensure all memory bank files accurately reflect the current state of the project, including the `mcp-backlog-server`.

## Known Issues (from initialization process and ongoing work)
-   The `list_code_definition_names` tool did not find top-level definitions in the `src` directories of several module-specific crates (e.g., `backlog-issue/src`, `backlog-project/src`). This is noted in `techContext.md`.
-   The `download_attachment` method in `backlog-document/src/api.rs` is a placeholder and requires `client::Client` modification for full functionality.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
-   **Initial Project Setup**: Focused on creating the Backlog API client library and CLI.
-   **`backlog-document` Crate**: Implemented based on user request for Document API features.
-   **MCP Server Request**: User requested creation of an MCP server with a `get_issue_details` tool.
-   **Discovery of Existing MCP Server**: During the "update memory-bank" task (current), it was discovered that the `mcp-backlog-server` crate with the requested tool (and more) already exists.
-   **Current Task Focus**: Shifted from creating the MCP server to accurately documenting its existing structure and functionality within the Memory Bank.
