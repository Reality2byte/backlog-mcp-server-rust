## Current Work Focus
-   Implemented `get_version_milestone_list` MCP tool in the `mcp-backlog-server` crate.
-   Updating Memory Bank to reflect this new MCP tool implementation.

## Recent Changes
-   **`mcp-backlog-server` crate changes for `get_version_milestone_list` tool:**
    -   Defined `GetVersionMilestoneListRequest` struct in `mcp-backlog-server/src/server.rs`.
    -   Implemented `get_version_milestone_list_impl` helper function in `mcp-backlog-server/src/issue.rs` to call the `backlog-issue` client library.
    -   Added `get_version_milestone_list` tool method to `Server` in `mcp-backlog-server/src/server.rs`, exposing it as an MCP tool.
    -   Confirmed `mcp-backlog-server` crate compilation with `cargo check`.
-   **Previous (`backlog-issue` crate) changes for `get_version_milestone_list` API:**
    -   Reviewed Backlog API documentation for `get_version_milestone_list`.
    -   Modified `backlog-issue/src/models/issue.rs`: Added `display_order: Option<i32>` to `Milestone` struct.
    -   Modified `backlog-issue/src/api/mod.rs`: Added `get_version_milestone_list` async method to `IssueApi`, type alias, and unit tests.
    -   Resolved compilation errors and confirmed project-wide compilation.
-   Previous work also involved understanding and documenting the existing `mcp-backlog-server`.

## Next Steps
-   Update `progress.md` to reflect the implementation of the `get_version_milestone_list` MCP tool.
-   Confirm completion of the task with the user.


## Active Decisions & Considerations
-   The project is a Rust workspace for a Backlog API client and CLI.
-   The modular structure (crates for core, issue, project, etc.) is a key architectural pattern.
-   The `client` crate seems to be a generic HTTP client, while `backlog-api-client` is the specific Backlog API orchestrator.

## Important Patterns & Preferences
-   The project follows standard Rust project structure and conventions (e.g., `Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs` or `src/bin/`).
-   Use of workspace for managing multiple related crates.

## Learnings & Project Insights
-   The project is well-structured into logical components (crates).
-   The presence of `blg.rs` in `backlog-api-client/src/bin/` strongly indicates a CLI component.
-   Core data types are centralized in `backlog-core`.
