## Current Work Focus
-   Implemented `get_version_milestone_list` API in the `backlog-issue` crate.
-   Updating Memory Bank to reflect this new API implementation.

## Recent Changes
-   Reviewed Backlog API documentation for `get_version_milestone_list`.
-   Modified `backlog-issue/src/models/issue.rs`:
    -   Added `display_order: Option<i32>` to the `Milestone` struct.
-   Modified `backlog-issue/src/api/mod.rs`:
    -   Added the `get_version_milestone_list` async method to `IssueApi`.
    -   Added `GetVersionMilestoneListResponse = Vec<Milestone>` type alias.
    -   Added unit tests for `get_version_milestone_list` (success and error cases) using `wiremock`.
-   Resolved compilation errors related to `ProjectIdOrKey` conversion to `String` by using `.to_string()` and by using `.parse().unwrap()` and `.clone()` in test code.
-   Confirmed project-wide compilation with `cargo check`.
-   Previous work involved understanding and documenting the existing `mcp-backlog-server`.

## Next Steps
-   Update `progress.md` to reflect the implementation of `get_version_milestone_list`.
-   Confirm completion of the task with the user.


## Active Decisions & Considerations
-   The project is a Rust workspace for a Backlog API client and CLI.
-   The modular structure (crates for core, issue, project, etc.) is a key architectural pattern.
-   The `client` crate seems to be a generic HTTP client, while `backlog-api-client` is the specific Backlog API orchestrator.

## Important Patterns & Preferences
-   The project follows standard Rust project structure and conventions (e.g., `Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs` or `src/bin/`).
-   Use of workspace for managing multiple related crates.

## Learnings & Project Insights
-   The project is well-structured into logical components (crates).
-   The presence of `blg.rs` in `backlog-api-client/src/bin/` strongly indicates a CLI component.
-   Core data types are centralized in `backlog-core`.
