# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
-   Initializing the Memory Bank for the Backlog API Client project.
-   Populating core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) based on initial analysis of the existing project structure and files.

## Recent Changes
-   Created all six core Memory Bank files with initial placeholder content.
-   Read the initial content of all six core Memory Bank files.
-   Analyzed project structure by listing files in:
    -   `backlog-api-client/`
    -   `backlog-api-core/`
    -   `backlog-core/`
    -   `backlog-issue/`
    -   `backlog-project/`
    -   `backlog-space/`
    -   `backlog-user/`
    -   `client/`
    -   `src/`
-   Read the content of the main `Cargo.toml` file.
-   Collected code definitions from:
    -   `backlog-api-client/src/`
    -   `backlog-api-core/src/`
    -   `backlog-core/src/`
    -   `client/src/`
    -   (Noted that `backlog-issue/src/`, `backlog-project/src/`, `backlog-space/src/`, `backlog-user/src/`, and `src/` did not yield top-level definitions directly, likely due to module structures).
-   Populated `projectbrief.md` with an overview of the project.
-   Populated `productContext.md` with the problem solved, how it should work, and user experience goals.

## Next Steps
-   Populate `systemPatterns.md` with details about the system architecture, key technical decisions, and component relationships.
-   Populate `techContext.md` with information about technologies used, development setup, and dependencies.
-   Populate `progress.md` with the current status of the project (initial memory bank population).
-   Confirm completion of the memory bank initialization task.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
-   The project is a Rust workspace for a Backlog API client and CLI.
-   The modular structure (crates for core, issue, project, etc.) is a key architectural pattern.
-   The `client` crate seems to be a generic HTTP client, while `backlog-api-client` is the specific Backlog API orchestrator.

## Important Patterns & Preferences
-   The project follows standard Rust project structure and conventions (e.g., `Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs` or `src/bin/`).
-   Use of workspace for managing multiple related crates.

## Learnings & Project Insights
-   The project is well-structured into logical components (crates).
-   The presence of `blg.rs` in `backlog-api-client/src/bin/` strongly indicates a CLI component.
-   Core data types are centralized in `backlog-core`.
