## Current Work Focus
-   Implemented `update_issue` MCP tool in `mcp-backlog-server`.
-   Updating Memory Bank to reflect this new tool and its feature flag.

## Recent Changes
-   **`update_issue` MCP Tool Implementation in `mcp-backlog-server`:**
    -   Added `issue_writable = ["backlog-api-client/issue_writable"]` feature to `mcp-backlog-server/Cargo.toml`.
    -   Defined `UpdateIssueRequest` struct (fields: `issue_id_or_key`, `summary`, `description`) in `mcp-backlog-server/src/server.rs`.
    -   Added `NothingToUpdate` error variant to `mcp-backlog-server/src/error.rs` and updated its `From<Error> for McpError` impl.
    -   Implemented `update_issue_impl` helper function in `mcp-backlog-server/src/issue.rs`, guarded by `#[cfg(feature = "issue_writable")]`. This function checks if both summary and description are None, returning `NothingToUpdate` error if so. Otherwise, it calls the client library's `update_issue`.
    -   Added `update_issue` tool method to `Server` in `mcp-backlog-server/src/server.rs`, guarded by `#[cfg(feature = "issue_writable")]`.
    -   Corrected `Cargo.toml` format error.
    -   Confirmed compilation with `cargo check --features issue_writable` (though output capture failed, command reported success).
-   **Previous Suggestion Feature for `MilestoneNotFoundByName` in `mcp-backlog-server`:**
    -   Added `strsim` crate.
    -   Modified `MilestoneNotFoundByName` error to include `suggestions`.
    -   Updated `get_issues_by_milestone_name_impl` to use preprocessing and Levenshtein distance for suggestions.
-   **Further Previous Error Message Improvement in `mcp-backlog-server`:**
    -   Improved `MilestoneNotFoundByName` error message to suggest `get_version_milestone_list`.
-   **`mcp-backlog-server` crate changes for `get_issues_by_milestone_name` tool (further prior):**
    -   Defined `GetIssuesByMilestoneNameRequest` struct.
    -   Implemented initial `get_issues_by_milestone_name_impl` helper.
    -   Added `get_issues_by_milestone_name` tool method.
    -   Added `MilestoneNotFoundByName` error variant.
    -   Added `From<ProjectId/ProjectKey> for ProjectIdOrKey` in `backlog-core`.
-   **`mcp-backlog-server` crate changes for `get_version_milestone_list` tool (further prior):**
    -   Defined `GetVersionMilestoneListRequest` struct.
    -   Implemented `get_version_milestone_list_impl` helper function.
    -   Added `get_version_milestone_list` tool method.
-   **Previous (`backlog-issue` crate) changes for `get_version_milestone_list` API:**
    -   Modified `Milestone` struct (added `display_order`).
    -   Added `get_version_milestone_list` async method and tests.
-   Previous work also involved understanding and documenting the existing `mcp-backlog-server`.


## Next Steps
-   Update `progress.md` to reflect the error message improvement.
-   Confirm completion of the task with the user.


## Active Decisions & Considerations
-   The project is a Rust workspace for a Backlog API client and CLI.
-   The modular structure (crates for core, issue, project, etc.) is a key architectural pattern.
-   The `client` crate seems to be a generic HTTP client, while `backlog-api-client` is the specific Backlog API orchestrator.

## Important Patterns & Preferences
-   The project follows standard Rust project structure and conventions (e.g., `Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs` or `src/bin/`).
-   Use of workspace for managing multiple related crates.

## Learnings & Project Insights
-   The project is well-structured into logical components (crates).
-   The presence of `blg.rs` in `backlog-api-client/src/bin/` strongly indicates a CLI component.
-   Core data types are centralized in `backlog-core`.
