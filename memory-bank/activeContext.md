# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
<<<<<<< HEAD
-   Completed initial implementation of Backlog MCP Server and the `get_issue_details` tool.

## Recent Changes
-   Read all core Memory Bank files.
-   Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` for the `backlog-document` task.
-   Analyzed user-provided API details and curl examples for Document API.
-   User created the `backlog-document` crate.
-   Verified `backlog-document` was added to workspace members in root `Cargo.toml`.
-   Created and populated `backlog-document/Cargo.toml` with dependencies.
-   Created `backlog-document/src/lib.rs` to declare modules.
-   Created `backlog-document/src/models.rs` with `Document`, `DocumentDetail`, `DocumentTreeResponse`, `DocumentTreeNode` structs.
-   Created `backlog-document/src/requests.rs` with `ListDocumentsParams`, `GetDocumentTreeParams` structs and `DocumentSortKey` enum, along with `From` trait implementations.
-   Addressed `Default` trait issues for request structs and `Debug/Clone/PartialEq/Eq/Hash/Serialize/Deserialize` for `ProjectIdOrKey`.
-   Created `backlog-document/src/api.rs` with `DocumentApi` struct and methods: `list_documents`, `get_document_tree`, `get_document`, and a placeholder `download_attachment`.
-   Fixed import paths and added `reqwest` dependency to `backlog-document/Cargo.toml`.
-   Added `backlog-document` as an optional dependency and feature to `backlog-api-client/Cargo.toml`.
-   Added `document()` method to `BacklogApiClient` in `backlog-api-client/src/client.rs`.
-   Read all core Memory Bank files.
-   Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` for the Backlog MCP Server task.
-   Loaded and reviewed MCP Rust SDK documentation.
-   User created new crate `mcp-backlog-server`.
-   Created initial file structure within `mcp-backlog-server/src/`:
    -   `main.rs` with placeholder server logic.
    -   `tools/mod.rs`
    -   `tools/get_issue_details_tool.rs` with schema and initial `call` logic for `GetIssueDetailsTool`.
-   Updated `mcp-backlog-server/Cargo.toml` with necessary dependencies including `model-context-protocol`, `tokio`, `serde`, `serde_json`, and local workspace crates (`backlog-api-client`, `backlog-core`, `backlog-issue`).
-   Updated `mcp-backlog-server/src/main.rs` with basic MCP server setup using `model-context-protocol` SDK components and registered `GetIssueDetailsTool`.
-   Updated MCP settings file (`cline_mcp_settings.json`) to include configuration for the new `backlog_mcp_server`.

## Next Steps
-   Task complete. Awaiting review or next task.
-   (Future considerations: Fully implement `download_attachment`, add tests for `backlog-document`, refine error handling and model details).


## Active Decisions & Considerations
-   The project is a Rust workspace for a Backlog API client and CLI.
-   The modular structure (crates for core, issue, project, etc.) is a key architectural pattern.
-   The `client` crate seems to be a generic HTTP client, while `backlog-api-client` is the specific Backlog API orchestrator.

## Important Patterns & Preferences
-   The project follows standard Rust project structure and conventions (e.g., `Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs` or `src/bin/`).
-   Use of workspace for managing multiple related crates.

## Learnings & Project Insights
-   The project is well-structured into logical components (crates).
-   The presence of `blg.rs` in `backlog-api-client/src/bin/` strongly indicates a CLI component.
-   Core data types are centralized in `backlog-core`.
