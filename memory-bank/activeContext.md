# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
-   Completed initial implementation of Backlog MCP Server and the `get_issue_details` tool.

## Recent Changes
-   Read all core Memory Bank files.
-   Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` for the Backlog MCP Server task.
-   Loaded and reviewed MCP Rust SDK documentation.
-   User created new crate `mcp-backlog-server`.
-   Created initial file structure within `mcp-backlog-server/src/`:
    -   `main.rs` with placeholder server logic.
    -   `tools/mod.rs`
    -   `tools/get_issue_details_tool.rs` with schema and initial `call` logic for `GetIssueDetailsTool`.
-   Updated `mcp-backlog-server/Cargo.toml` with necessary dependencies including `model-context-protocol`, `tokio`, `serde`, `serde_json`, and local workspace crates (`backlog-api-client`, `backlog-core`, `backlog-issue`).
-   Updated `mcp-backlog-server/src/main.rs` with basic MCP server setup using `model-context-protocol` SDK components and registered `GetIssueDetailsTool`.
-   Updated MCP settings file (`cline_mcp_settings.json`) to include configuration for the new `backlog_mcp_server`.

## Next Steps
-   Task complete. The user will need to:
    1.  Build the `mcp-backlog-server` binary (`cargo build --bin mcp-backlog-server`).
    2.  Ensure the `command` path in `cline_mcp_settings.json` correctly points to the compiled binary.
    3.  Test the MCP server and the `get_issue_details` tool.
-   (Future considerations: Implement more tools, refine error handling, add server-side tests).

## Active Decisions & Considerations
-   The project is a Rust workspace for a Backlog API client and CLI.
-   The modular structure (crates for core, issue, project, etc.) is a key architectural pattern.
-   The `client` crate seems to be a generic HTTP client, while `backlog-api-client` is the specific Backlog API orchestrator.

## Important Patterns & Preferences
-   The project follows standard Rust project structure and conventions (e.g., `Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs` or `src/bin/`).
-   Use of workspace for managing multiple related crates.

## Learnings & Project Insights
-   The project is well-structured into logical components (crates).
-   The presence of `blg.rs` in `backlog-api-client/src/bin/` strongly indicates a CLI component.
-   Core data types are centralized in `backlog-core`.
