# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
-   Completed implementation of `IssueIdOrKey` enum in the `backlog-core` crate.

## Recent Changes
-   Read all core Memory Bank files.
-   Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` for the `IssueIdOrKey` implementation task.
-   Analyzed `project_id_or_key.rs`, `identifier.rs`, and `issue_key.rs` from `backlog-core`.
-   Created `backlog-core/src/issue_id_or_key.rs` and implemented the `IssueIdOrKey` enum with `FromStr`, `Display`, `From<IssueId>`, `From<IssueKey>`, `Into<String>`, `Serialize`, and `Deserialize` traits, along with unit tests.
-   Updated `backlog-core/src/lib.rs` to declare and re-export the `issue_id_or_key` module and `IssueIdOrKey` type.
-   Corrected the import path for `IssueIdOrKey` in `backlog-issue/src/api/mod.rs`.

## Next Steps
-   Task complete. Awaiting review or next task.
-   The `update_issue` functionality in `backlog-issue` should now compile correctly with the new `IssueIdOrKey` type.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
-   The project is a Rust workspace for a Backlog API client and CLI.
-   The modular structure (crates for core, issue, project, etc.) is a key architectural pattern.
-   The `client` crate seems to be a generic HTTP client, while `backlog-api-client` is the specific Backlog API orchestrator.

## Important Patterns & Preferences
-   The project follows standard Rust project structure and conventions (e.g., `Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs` or `src/bin/`).
-   Use of workspace for managing multiple related crates.

## Learnings & Project Insights
-   The project is well-structured into logical components (crates).
-   The presence of `blg.rs` in `backlog-api-client/src/bin/` strongly indicates a CLI component.
-   Core data types are centralized in `backlog-core`.
